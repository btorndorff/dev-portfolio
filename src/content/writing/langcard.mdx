Generative language learning flashcards powered by AI to help create effective study materials. I created this because I couldn't find a good Anki set for Vietnamese anywhere.

## Features

- **Text and audio input** - Create cards from text or record audio directly
- **Example sentence generation** - AI generates contextual example sentences
- **Native level TTS audio generation** - High quality audio for pronunciation practice
- **Exportable to Anki or Quizlet** - Use your cards in your favorite flashcard app

## Tech Stack

Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript on the frontend with a Python Flask backend. The AI features are powered by OpenAI API for text generation and ElevenLabs API + Google TTS for audio generation.
